          My first and only internship I landed was last summer at The Davey
          Tree Expert Company, as a <b>Software Engineer Intern</b>. This was a
          remote opportunity, during my time there that is from June 2022 -
          September 2022, I had the chance to collaborate with highly skilled
          mentors and contribute code towards the creation of an internal
          SPA(single page application) used for creation of Business Partners.
          We used a JavaScript front-end library called SAPUI5.
