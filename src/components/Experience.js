          I’m currently a <b>Front-End Software Engineer</b> at Circularity, where I’m building a dynamic KPI dashboard for aluminum manufacturing plants. I’ve implemented reusable, modular chart components using <b>Chart.js</b> and <b>Redux</b>, with full integration to live backend data streams—helping reduce alloy costs while maintaining spec adherence.

          Prior to this, I worked at Quadrantic IQ on Toyota’s prototype vehicle BOM system. As a <b>Full-Stack Software Engineer</b>, I built and deployed AWS Lambda microservices using the Serverless Framework, improved a key graph traversal algorithm to 100% accuracy, and delivered a BOM comparison export tool used in engineering workflows.
